# CS50 Python — Problem Sets & Foundations

This repository contains my solutions and learning progress for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

It is part of a broader, long-term learning path focused on:

- Strong Python foundations
- Systems thinking
- Applied AI / AGI system design
- Building real-world problem-solving skills through code



## What’s inside

- CS50 Python Problem Sets Week 6 
- Exercises focused on logic, algorithms, and clean code
- Practical problems such as:
  - Readability analysis
  - Credit card validation
  - DNA sequence matching
- Progressive improvement of Python fundamentals

Each problem is solved with an emphasis on:
- Understanding the **logic first**
- Writing **clear and readable code**
- Leveraging AI tools responsibly to accelerate learning

##  Why this repository exists

> To become an **AGI Applied Systems Designer**, capable of modeling complex systems, simulating outcomes, and building intelligent tools that help humans make better decisions.

Python is the first technical layer of that journey.



## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Git & GitHub
- CS50 curriculum
- Command-line tools

 Applied AGI projects (law, sustainability, culture, economics)
